# Project_Trojan_Horse

## Trojan Horse: 
A Python script using ProGPT and ChatGPT to ask AI if the first 50 words of a text file were generated by it, sparking a unique collaboration between human and machine creativity.

## Imports:

- os: Facilitates interactions with the operating system, such as accessing files and directories.

- subprocess: Enables running external commands and processes from within the Python code.
## Functions:

### 1. read_text_file(file_path, num_words=50):

Purpose:
Reads a specified text file.
Extracts a certain number of words from the beginning.
Interacts with ChatGPT to determine if those words were generated by it.
Parameters:
file_path: The path to the text file to be analyzed.
num_words (optional): The number of words to extract (defaults to 50).
Steps:
Opens the specified file in read mode.
Reads the entire content of the file.
Prints the first num_words words.
Prompts ChatGPT with those words and the question "Is this generated by you?"
Prints ChatGPT's response.
Handles potential errors (file not found, etc.).
### 2. main():

Purpose: The main entry point of the program.
Steps:
Constructs the full path to the text file "trojan_test.txt" in the "/content" directory.
Calls the read_text_file function to process the specified file.
## Conditional Statement:

if __name__ == "__main__":
Ensures the main() function is executed only when the script is run directly, not when imported as a module.
## Overall Purpose:

Experiments with detecting text generated by ChatGPT.
Reads a text file, extracts a portion, and asks ChatGPT if it was generated by it.
Prints ChatGPT's response.
