# Project_Trojan_Horse

## Trojan Horse: 
A Python script using ProGPT and ChatGPT to ask AI if the first 50 words of a text file were generated by it, sparking a unique collaboration between human and machine creativity.

## Imports:

- os: Facilitates interactions with the operating system, such as accessing files and directories.

- subprocess: Enables running external commands and processes from within the Python code.
## Functions:

### 1. read_text_file(file_path, num_words=50):

**Purpose:**
- Reads a specified text file.
- Extracts a certain number of words from the beginning.
- Interacts with ChatGPT to determine if those words were generated by it.

**Parameters:**
- `file_path`: The path to the text file to be analyzed.
- `num_words` (optional): The number of words to extract (defaults to 50).

**Steps:**
1. Opens the specified file in read mode.
2. Reads the entire content of the file.
3. Prints the first `num_words` words.
4. Prompts ChatGPT with those words and the question "Is this generated by you?"
5. Prints ChatGPT's response.
6. Handles potential errors (file not found, etc.).

### 2. main():

**Purpose:** 
- The main entry point of the program.

**Steps:**
1. Constructs the full path to the text file "trojan_test.txt" in the "/content" directory.
2. Calls the `read_text_file` function to process the specified file.
## Conditional Statement:

if __name__ == "__main__":
Ensures the main() function is executed only when the script is run directly, not when imported as a module.
## Overall Purpose:

Experiments with detecting text generated by ChatGPT.
Reads a text file, extracts a portion, and asks ChatGPT if it was generated by it.
Prints ChatGPT's response.
